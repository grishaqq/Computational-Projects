# Monte Carlo + Random Boolean Satisfiability

Monte Carlo project aims to analyze Monte Carlo methods in context of approximating volumes of spheres and random polytopes in multiple dimensions (regular Monte Carlo, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, error analysis, lots of graph plotting)

Random Boolean Satisfiability project aims to analyze random CNF formulas (in particular ones, that have structure: CNF with m clauses, n variables and k litterals in each clause) (analyzing likeliness of satisfiability, analyzing maximum satisfiability, implementing max-sat solver, analysis of my max-sat solver, lots of graph plotting)
